I have added several files. We should add our findings to the Advertising Positioning powerpoint file and document file 
for the presentation and report respectively. You both sould be able to open vip_graph.html is a browser and see a line 
graph of the customer ids on the x axis and the number of purchases on the y axis. This is not a snapshot of the entire 
dataset, however. It is of file D01.

I am using the following tools to process the data files:

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/tools/workbench/ (MySQL Workbench)
http://aptana.com/ (Aptana Web Development IDE)
http://www.wampserver.com/en/ (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP installation stack)

Last night we installed WAMP on Feng Fan's computer and copied the repository contents to the C:\wamp\www\ directory. He 
could then type localhost into a web browser and bring up the WAMP default page and then navigate to the files and 
display them. With all of the files in the repository if you want to run them you simply need to navigate to them in the 
web browser and they will execute.

MySQL Database
--------------
I did not have time to backup the database and get it uploaded last night. I forgot my computer at home today so I will 
have to back it up tonight and upload it. I will do that when I get home at approximately 6 PM tonight. I will be using 
the following tutorial to back it up which you may also use to restore it on your computer:

Template Files
--------------
I have made notes in the vip_graph.html file and the create_vip_data.php file. The notes tell you what to change so that 
you may generate a tsv file with the php file and then display the tsv file with the html file. Let me know if you would
like to generate data files with more than two columns or would like another method of displaying the data such as a bar
chart or scatterplot. I can template some files for you pretty quickly.
